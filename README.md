# lule
===

A bash(y) alternative to [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) by mostly using [pastel](https://github.com/sharkdp/pastel). The advantages from __pywal__ are that, __lule__ genretarates all 255 colors from an image and the other BIG BIG advantage is that it's composed of many tools and all are in a bash script, so you can chnage anything. All the tools are binaries so you're saved form dependency hell.
